# Personal Website using GitHub
Hi, I am Olga. I am a grad student at the University of Rochester, and I use GitHub to create my website. 

The website is written in the HTML. 
The theme that has been used to create the website is designed and kindly provided by the FreeHTML5.co (http://freehtml5.co/).
